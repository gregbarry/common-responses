            <h4>Create a Response</h4>
            <p>To create a response, simply select the text and "right+click".  Highlight "Common Responses" in your
                context menu and then select "Create Response from Selection".</p>

            <h4>Placing a Response</h4>
            <p>To post one of your saved responses, just click within the textarea and "right+click".  Select the
                response you'd like to use, and it should appear within your form field.</p>

            <h4>Editing a Response</h4>
            <p>You can edit your responses (and the titles that appear in the context menus) by clicking on this extension's
                icon in your toolbar.  This will create a popup window in which you can update your text.  Just make your
                changes and click "update".</p>

            <h4>Deleting a Response</h4>
            <p>You can delete a response by clicking on this extension's icon in your toolbar.  This will create a
                popup window in which you can delete your response.  Just make your changes and click "delete".</p>

            <h4>Using Placeholders</h4>
            <p>You can also use placeholders in your responses.  Just add a variable name within double brackets like this:<br>
            <pre>[[name]]</pre>
            </p>
            <p>This will cause a prompt to appear whenever you place a response.  The value that you enter will replace
                the placeholder.</p>

            <h4>Using Includes</h4>
            <p>You can also use include other responses within your responses.  Just add the number of your desired response within
                double dollar signs like this:<br>
            <pre>$$3$$</pre>
            </p>
            <p>This will include the referenced response.  Includes are ideal for signatures and tag lines.</p>

            <p>This is my first extension and it was built in a very short amount of time and most certainly has issues.
