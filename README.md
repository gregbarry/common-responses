# Common Responses
Common Responses is a Chrome Extension that allows users to create clips of text 
that can be saved and later inserted into input areas.

##Create a Response
To create a response, simply select the text and "right+click".  Highlight "Common Responses" in your
context menu and then select "Create Response from Selection".

##Placing a Response
To post one of your saved responses, just click within the textarea and "right+click".  Select the
response you'd like to use, and it should appear within your form field.

##Editing a Response
You can edit your responses (and the titles that appear in the context menus) by clicking on this extension's
icon in your toolbar.  This will create a popup window in which you can update your text.  Just make your
changes and click "update".

##Deleting a Response
You can delete a response by clicking on this extension's icon in your toolbar.  This will create a
popup window in which you can delete your response.  Just make your changes and click "delete".

##Using Placeholders
You can also use placeholders in your responses.  Just add a variable name within double brackets like this:

  [[name]]

This will cause a prompt to appear whenever you place a response.  The value that you enter will replace the placeholder.

#Using Includes
You can also use include other responses within your responses.  Just add the number of your desired response within 
double dollar signs like this:

  $$3$$
  
This will include the referenced response.  Includes are ideal for signatures and tag lines.
